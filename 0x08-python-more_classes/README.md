# 0. Simple rectangle
an empty class Rectangle that defines a rectangle
# 1. Real definition of a rectangle
a class Rectangle that defines a rectangle by:
 * Private instance attribute: width.
 * Private instance attribute: height.
 * Instantiation with optional width and height.
# 2. Area and Perimeter
a class Rectangle that defines a rectangle by:
 * Private instance attribute: width.
 * Private instance attribute: height.
 * Instantiation with optional width and height.
 * Public instance method: def area(self): that returns the rectangle area
 * Public instance method: def perimeter(self): that returns the rectangle perimeter
# 3. String representation
a class Rectangle that defines a rectangle by:
 * Private instance attribute: width.
 * Private instance attribute: height.
 * Instantiation with optional width and height.
 * Public instance method: def area(self): that returns the rectangle area
 * Public instance method: def perimeter(self): that returns the rectangle perimeter
 * print() and str() should print the rectangle with the character
 # 4. Eval is magic
 a class Rectangle that defines a rectangle by:
 * Private instance attribute: width.
 * Private instance attribute: height.
 * Instantiation with optional width and height.
 * Public instance method: def area(self): that returns the rectangle area
 * Public instance method: def perimeter(self): that returns the rectangle perimeter
 * print() and str() should print the rectangle with the character
 * repr() should return a string representation of the rectangle to be able to recreate a new instance by using eval()
